# üß† Approach Explanation ‚Äî Challenge 1B

## üéØ Objective

Design and implement a **persona-aware intelligent document processing pipeline** that:
- Parses a set of PDF documents,
- Understands a given persona and their job-to-be-done,
- Extracts the most relevant sections and subsections,
- Outputs results in a structured and human-readable JSON format.

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Methodology

### 1. üìù Input Parsing

We start by parsing a metadata file (`challenge1b_input.json`) which includes:
- `persona`: either a string or dictionary (`{"role": ...}`),
- `job_to_be_done`: either a string or dictionary (`{"task": ...}`),
- The document collection (PDFs).

Code handles all safe extraction scenarios using conditional checks.

### 2. üìÑ PDF Section Extraction

- **Library used**: [`PyMuPDF` (fitz)]
- Extracts:
  - Text blocks from each page.
  - Blocks with minimum 50 characters are considered for section analysis.
  - Page number is recorded.
- Normalizes the `document` field to show only filenames (e.g., `abc.pdf` instead of `path/to/abc.pdf`).

```python
if len(text.strip()) >= 50:
    results.append({
        "document": os.path.basename(doc_path),
        "text": text,
        "page_number": page_number
    })
```

### 3. üß† Relevance Ranking with Rule-Based Scoring

- **No embeddings** used to optimize runtime.
- Instead, a **keyword-boosted relevance scoring system** is implemented in `ranker.py`.
- Scoring logic considers:
  - Keywords matching job or persona intent.
  - Presence of task-specific words: `form`, `signature`, `fill`, `convert`, etc.
  - Shorter phrases prioritized as section titles.
- Top 5 sections are selected with `importance_rank` assigned.

---

### 4. üìå Subsection Analysis (Summarizer Simulation)

- Each selected section is passed to a refinement function:
  - Generates a template-based summary:  
    _"To understand '<section_title>', ensure you review all interactive elements..."_
  - Ensures bullet points and special Unicode characters (e.g., `‚Ä¢`) are preserved via `ensure_ascii=False` in JSON output.
- Sections missing any of `document`, `section_title`, or `page_number` are skipped with warnings.

---

### 5. üßæ Output JSON Format

Structured into three main fields:

```json
{
  "metadata": { ... },
  "extracted_sections": [
    {
      "document": "xyz.pdf",
      "section_title": "...",
      "page_number": 2,
      "importance_rank": 1
    },
    ...
  ],
  "subsection_analysis": [
    {
      "document": "xyz.pdf",
      "refined_text": "...",
      "page_number": 2
    }
  ]
}
```
